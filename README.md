Cooperative Binding Modeling

This R code estimates transcription factor-DNA binding affinities and cooperative binding constants from gel mobility shift data. Using half-site and two-site binding data, the model performs a global fit of the two experiments, and jointly estimates binding affinities and cooperative constants. This model is originally inspired from the Senear and Brenowitz 1991 binding model for mobility shift data, and modified to perform join non-linear regression estimation.
